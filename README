IPython subapp that supports adding arbitrary notebooks from the command line. 
It supports the normal notebook directory use. 
Files added via the CLI will create their own notebook list on the project page. 

**Make sure to put the bin files in your path.**

# ipycli is essentially `ipython notebook` with the extra features baked in
ipycli --ip="*" --port=8888

# Existing notebooks will be attached to the 
nb existing_notebook.ipynb

# Specifying a new file can be done with or without .ipynb
nb new_notebook
nb new_notebook.ipynb

# Add a notebook dir
nb add-dir some_directory

* Added an autosave. The file will be .[name].ipynb.[client_id].save
client_id is random id for each browser window. Right now, it's just there for crsis prevention.

* Added a persistence. It just pickeles the notebook dirs and pathed notebooks.

* Add some prelim work to get gist to work as a backend. 

--github-user=user --github-pw=pw 

will get you gist access. Your gists must have #notebook in the description. Each Gist is treated like a project folder. 
You can access files separately via the ipython notebook manager. 

Creating new files and renaming have not been added. Note that an emtpy gist file won't show up, so if you want to create a 
new file manually you will actually need to paste in a nb json.
